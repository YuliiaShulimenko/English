2) You are a team lead giving feedback to your team member who is not taking initiative in their work. 
3) You are a project manager giving feedback to a colleague who is not meeting deadlines.

I choosed number 3

1. Sit down with the staff member and ask what’s going on, and listen with an open mind. 
Start out by simply naming the problem and asking for the staff person’s perspective: 
“You’ve been missing deadlines lately. What’s been happening?” Then, give her some room to talk.

2. Talk about the impact of the missed deadlines.
For example, I might say, “When you turned in your billings so late,  ended up having to work over the weekend to get invoices out on time.” 

3. Ask what tools your employee is using to track projects and deadlines.

5. Talk about next steps.
 If the conversation hasn’t already produced clear ideas that the employee will try, ask directly, “What would it make sense to do differently going forward?”
